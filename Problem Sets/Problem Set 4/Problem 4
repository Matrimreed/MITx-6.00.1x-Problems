Problem 4 - Hand Length
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. We'll be implementing the playHand function. This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to implement the helper calculateHandlen function, which can be done in under five lines of code.

def calculateHandlen(hand):
    """ 
    Returns the length (number of letters) in the current hand.
    
    hand: dictionary (string int)
    returns: integer
    """
    length = 0
    list_of_values = list(hand.values())
    for value in list_of_values:
        length += value
    return length
