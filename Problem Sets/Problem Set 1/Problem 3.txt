Problem 3
15.0/15.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

current_string = s[0]
longest_string = s[0]

for i in range(1, len(s)):
    if s[i] >= current_string[-1]:
        current_string = current_string + s[i]
        if len(current_string) > len(longest_string):
            longest_string = current_string
    else:
        current_string = s[i]
print(longest_string)
