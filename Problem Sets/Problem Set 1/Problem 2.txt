Problem 2
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Number of times bob occurs is: 2

name = 'bob'
bob_total = 0
for ele in range(len(s)):
    if ele >= len(s) or ele + 1 >= len(s) or ele + 2 >= len(s):
        print("Outside of range!!")
        break
    elif (s[ele] + s[ele + 1] + s[ele + 2]) == name:
        bob_total += 1
    #else:
        #print((s[ele] + s[ele + 1] + s[ele + 2]))
print("Number of times bob occurs is:", bob_total)
