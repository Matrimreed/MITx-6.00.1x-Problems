Problem 3
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Implement a function that meets the specifications below.

def sum_digits(s):
    """ assumes s a string
        Returns an int that is the sum of all of the digits in s.
          If there are no digits in s it raises a ValueError exception. """
    # Your code here
For example, sum_digits("a;35d4") returns 12.

Paste your entire function, including the definition, in the box below. Do not leave any debugging print statements.

def sum_digits(s):
    total = 0
    non_ints = 0
    for letter in s:
            try:
                total += int(letter)
            except ValueError:
                non_ints += 1
    if len(s) == non_ints:
        raise ValueError
    return total
